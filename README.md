This repository contains the codes of around 60 problems in the project-euler website https://projecteuler.net

As the website quotes "Project Euler exists to encourage, challenge, and develop the skills and enjoyment of anyone with an interest in the fascinating world of mathematics.", I completely enjoyed spending days thinking about some of the great problems here. This website kept me engaged the entire summer of 2016 and sparked my interest in the world of algorithms and statistics. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to keep up after the summer vacations due to my course load at IIT Guwahati, but would love to share some of the codes here with everyone who finds herself stuck with one of these problems and needs some kind of a hint, but it is infinitely more joyful to be able to get finally to the answer

Anyone who wishes to look at some of the problems can visit this link https://projecteuler.net/archives

I was among the **top 2.5%** users of the website to have solved more than 50 problems. Most of these problems required a good knowledge of data structures and algorithms, which forced me to level up my knowledge of these topics.
